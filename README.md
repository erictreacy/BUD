# Beyond Use Date Calculator

This is a tool that I made to use for the lab. I am always having to calculate expiration dates and I wanted to use something that I created -- but, you can use it too! ; ) 

This application was made in Cloud9 for the fun of it. 

## Installation
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `node app.js` to run the server

## Compilation:
Run `make`, which will run our ruby script to generate index.html (minified), and index.html.gz (minified + gzipped)

### Ruby gems used:
- [HTML Press](https://github.com/stereobooster/html_press)
- [CSS Minify](https://github.com/matthiassiegel/cssminify)
